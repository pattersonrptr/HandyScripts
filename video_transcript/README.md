For the code to work, you need to download a Vosk model for the language used in the video for which you want to generate the transcript.

Download and extract the file in the correct directory (just look at how it is in the code). In my case, I am using a pt_br model. Since the models are very heavy, I did not include it in this repository.

The website with the models:
https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

Then just install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

And the system dependencies.
